Property Price Prediction Web Application
Overview
The Property Price Prediction Web Application is designed to predict real estate property prices based on various factors such as location, property size, number of rooms, amenities, and market dynamics. The application leverages machine learning models to process real-world property data and historical pricing records to provide accurate predictions. This tool is built to help buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions in the real estate market.

The application uses frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, along with machine learning models for price prediction. The models were trained using real estate datasets and enhanced using machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Deep Learning to provide high accuracy.

The system has been developed with scalability in mind, capable of handling large datasets and adapting to market changes, achieving a prediction accuracy of around 94%.

Features
Data-driven Price Prediction: Predict property prices using various input features like location, size, number of rooms, and amenities.

Machine Learning Models: Baseline models (Linear Regression and Decision Trees) were applied initially, followed by advanced models such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Deep Learning techniques to improve accuracy.

Interactive User Interface: A clean and responsive web interface built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript allows users to easily input property details and get predictions.

High Accuracy: The system provides a price prediction accuracy of approximately 94%.

Scalable and Adaptable: Capable of processing large datasets and adapting to evolving market trends.

Expandable: Future enhancements can include integration of external data such as economic trends or infrastructure developments for more accurate predictions.
